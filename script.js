// JS Logic Implementation into HTML Calculator (step 6)
// step 6: integrate js and html so the calculator works (user inputs an operation, calculator outputs the correct response)
// CALL the display numbers function to show which operands the user clicks
// CALL the store values function to store which operands and operator the user clicks
// CALL the operator function (pass it the result of the store values function to calculate the right result when the user clicks on the equal sign)
// CALL the display numbers function again to update the display with the result of the operator function
// IF operand variables are not null AND any non-equal sign operator button is clicked (aka a chained operation) THEN
    // SET the first operand variable to the result of the operation
    // CALL the operator function again (pass it the result of the store values function)
// CALL the clear function when the user clicks the clear button or if the user clicks a digit button
